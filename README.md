Introduction

The remaining records in the file will contain the following data:

WARD|ACCLAIMED| INCUMBENT |CANDIDATE NAME|TOTAL VOTES|LEADING BY|PERCENTAGE OF VOTES|WARD STATIONS REPORTING|TOTAL WARD STATIONS |CITY WIDE STATIONS REPORTING|TOTAL CITY WIDE STATIONS |OFFICE TYPE

Here's the actual output example:

The data file will be pipe delimited (1/2).
